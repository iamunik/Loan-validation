               <hr>

               <h3><u>Introduction:</u></h3>
               <p>Welcome to our file upload guideline page! This platform allows users to upload spreadsheet files to
                test a machine learning algorithm designed to predict the validity of customers for loan collection.</p>

               <h3><u>File Types:</u></h3>
               <p>You can upload files in the following formats:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Comma Seperated Values (.csv)</li>
                         <li>Excel spreadsheet (.xls)</li>
                    </ul>
               </p>

               <h3><u>User Authentication:</u></h3>
               <p>No user authentication is required for this test run. Feel free to upload files without the need to 
               log in.</p>

               <h3><u>Privacy and Security:</u></h3>
               <p>Rest assured, uploaded files are not stored on our servers. They are used solely for making 
               predictions, and your privacy and security are not compromised, as files are not retained and also please
            note that file uploads are not moderated or reviewed before processing, hence the need for users to read 
            through the <b>"Acceptable Content"</b> section thoroughly</p>

               <h3><u>Acceptable Content:</u></h3>
               <p>Uploaded files must follow a specific format and contain the following columns names with the 
               corresponding data types:</p>
