### User Input Prediction:
- Users have the option to manually input loan details through a user-friendly interface.
- Input fields cover essential loan parameters such as amount, duration, interest rate, etc.
- Predictions are generated based on the provided user inputs.

### File Upload Prediction:
This part of the web app is for the admin, incase there are customers that comes to check their eligibility and there 
are back logs the admin can upload a csv file or an excel file for the purpose of predicting the customers 
that are eligible for a loan.

### Limitations:
- This web app is not global for all loan companies, that is because the ML algorithm in use was created with data from
a particular source, if you want this you will have to <a href="https://oluwaseun-ogundeko.netlify.app/contact">

your organisation.
- This web app is mainly for testing purpose just to show what is possible using Machine Learning.
