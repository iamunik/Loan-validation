Incase you are wondering why there are two different variations of the same web app, well the explanation is simple, you see I built the Flask web app first and I have been having trouble uploading it anywhere; I have intially tried; **Render, Pythonanywhere and Vercel** and I was having the same issue on all three `dependencies were too large`. So I finally settled back on **Pythonanywhere** when I found out that they had pre-installed libraries `bottles`, but I encountered another issue on **pythonanywhere** my model wasn't returning any value when it was suppose to do so, after a lot of back and forth, I decided to settle on **streamlit**.
<br><br>
So incase you're wondering why I didn't debug and all, Oh I did, I started this project in 2023 and I was battling with deployment from then till 2024 :). So I settled on _free hosting platforms don't have the processing power for some web apps, nor do they have the space to hold all the important dependencies_, vercel for example gave a maximum of 300mb while pythonanywhere gave 512mb to hold everything. Luckily they have pre-installed libraries. Render on the other hand behaved like pythonanywhere, I couldn't get a prediction even after all my files have been duly uploaded but the rest of the web app was functioning properly.
<br><br>
So the summary of the matter is, both web apps are live but only the Streamlit version is functional. So there you have it, the not so interesting story of how I built a web app using two different technologies.<br><br>

Does this mean I know how to use both technologies??<br>
**YES** it means that I can use both :)
<br><br>
**_So there you have it folks please enjoy your stay._**

_PS: I have no idea why I explained this long :)_
